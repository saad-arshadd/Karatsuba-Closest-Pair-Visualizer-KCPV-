# Karatsuba-Closest-Pair-Visualizer-KCPV-
An interactive Python-based project developed for the Theory of Algorithms (TOA) course that visualizes two fundamental divide-and-conquer algorithms: Closest Pair of Points and Karatsuba Integer Multiplication. The project offers an intuitive UI using ipywidgets for selecting algorithms and input files.

The Closest Pair of Points algorithm efficiently identifies the nearest pair among a set of 2D points, visualizing the process by plotting all points and highlighting the closest pair along with their distance.

The Karatsuba Integer Multiplication algorithm performs efficient multiplication of large integers using a recursive approach, with the computation process visualized as a tree to offer insights into each multiplication step.

Input data is auto-generated and stored in text files, ensuring quick and easy testing. The project integrates visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Graphviz for an engaging and educational experience.
